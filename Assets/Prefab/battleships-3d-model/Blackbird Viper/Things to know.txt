Terms of Use


* You are welcomed to download all these models for your personal use and I hope you'll like them.

* All models are made by "SolCommand" from http://solcommand.blogspot.com/

* You can use my stuff for ANY project you want.

* You can edit my ships, space stations and everything else, however you like (rename, retexture, edit the mesh, etc) just don't claim them as your own ;)

* I always appreciate when people contact me to tell me about their projects and how much my models helped them ... *hint* hehe.

* If you notice bugs or errors with a model pls let me know so I'd try fix it asap !

* DO NOT complain about texture quality ! I get bored fast when texturing so if you want a better texture you can always do one yourself ;)

* That's about it, enjoy them and remember people, make Love not War ! :)
